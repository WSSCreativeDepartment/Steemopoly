For example, you invest in creation and the promotion of Photography Post 1. The field on the game board becames your ownership and each time you step on it, you get an upvote from the bank. If some other player steps on that field, his comment on that post get flagged and you get the benefits. 
There are also 4 ICO fields that you can make one-time investment there and get the triple amount when you step on that field again.
There are Tax-office fields, airdrop fields, day trade fields and penalty fields, it is easy to learn the rules only by laying.
